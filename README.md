## ✨ What it does

- **Live queue & occupancy** for the dining hall at the University of Patras (Rio campus)
- **Menu browsing** for **day / week / month**
- **Short-term forecast (≈ 2 hours)** to help you pick a quieter time
- **Privacy-respecting analytics** based on **local roaming Wi-Fi load** and **optional** in-app positional telemetry

> The system infers crowd levels by analyzing anonymized aggregate Wi-Fi activity from the venue’s roaming network (and, optionally, anonymized app visit data). Predictions provide a near-term outlook so you can plan your meal accordingly.
